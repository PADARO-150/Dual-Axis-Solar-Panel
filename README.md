# Dual-Axis-Solar-Panel
Arduino code for a two-axis solar panel model.

The project consists of two motors and 4 photoresistors (LDR) and simulates the movement of a solar panel both vertically and horizontally so that it is always pointing to the area with the most light and therefore the maximum possible benefit is obtained. The aim of this project is to automatically maximise the absorption of sunlight over the course of a day.
